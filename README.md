# (Depreciated, see https://github.com/Zorpal/nea) Hi there, this is my AQA Computer Science NEA 2024-2025, please make sure you use npm (as I have not implemented yarn), follow and check you have used these commands:

# pip install Django django-cors-headers djangorestframework
# npm install 

# Alternatively on Python3 later versions on macOS use: pip3 install <your package>
# And when referencing manage.py in Django, use: Python3 manage.py <your argument>
